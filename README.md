# word-games
handmade word games by yours truly. not all ideas my own, and i will credit inspiration where necessary. 

mostly using this space for practice in python. (practise? i don't know what spelling i like better) 
i might also use this space to practice other programming languages. 

interactive, fourth-wall-breaking media in general is fun, but i'm not at the level i'd be creating the next undertale or whatever.
so i make do with the limited skillset i have. :)

if i can display any finished word games in user-friendly, pretty ways, i will include links to relevant places where those games can be accessed, hopefully!
