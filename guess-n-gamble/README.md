# Guess 'n' Gamble! 
a fun (i.e. intentionally frustrating and tedious) high-stakes guessing game that was spawned in the abyss of my cruel imagination. the player (that's you!) attempts to guess the word that your opponent (an incredibly haughty and annoying computer) is thinking of. you are limited to up to three random hints per turn, unless you are willing to risk losing your well-deserved points - in other words, you can gamble away some of your earnings for *another* hint. the player is rewarded with even more points if they guess correctly, but they are punished heavily if they guess incorrectly.  

this project was inspired by a simple bulls-and-cows game that i programmed for class during my first year of college. i have not properly worked with python in several months, so it was at first intended to be a refresher of basic aspects of the language, but i decided that it would be fun to make my guessing game more "game-like," with a points system, more sophisticated interactivity, et cetera, et cetera. took some effort, but it was fun. 

guess 'n' gamble is not terribly complex, but i hope it is enjoyable. 

if you hate the game enough, i've also made an easy mode! i won't taunt you for taking advantage of it because i am also horrible at fighting against this monster of a program i've created. the computer will, though.
