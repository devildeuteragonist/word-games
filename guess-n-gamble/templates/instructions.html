<h2>Instructions</h2>

<ul>
<li>This game is best played with a pencil and paper in hand. Please do not look up any words. That is cheating!</li>
<li>Input is case-sensitive, and sensitive to SPACES and OTHER CHARACTERS!</li>
<li>The computer is also extremely obnoxious and I hate him.</li>
<li>Sometimes, you are given the chance to gamble some points for an extra hint.</li>
<li>As you use more hints in a round, the points you earn back are reduced if you succeed.</li>
<li>Points earned back from wagering are protected from this.</li>
</ul>
